# C# Tutorial - Create a simple platform game in windows form and visual studio
In this tutorial we will make a platform game using windows form, c# in visual studio. this tutorial took me a while to figure out but it was worth it in the end. It has platforms you can stand on and jump to, it has horizontally and vertically moving platforms.

We are using labels, picture boxes and timer to make this game work. We haven't used any third party libraries or classes to run the game its plain simple windows form. We make use of the standard components by making something fun inside of it also we make use of the events inside of windows form to respond to the user inputs and we use the main timer event to work as a main game loop. 

In this we will learn together how to make a simple platform game, where player can move left and jump up and down, move from the platform to platform, collect coins and finally complete the game. We make this so it give different end messages depending how you lose game for example it can give a end message if you got hit by the enemy or fell off the platform.
